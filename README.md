This repository contains the code for Puzzle 2020 and it's Openplanet Installer.  
The Installer obtains the latest version from this exact repository. (Given that ScriptVersion.txt has been edited)  

You can find the OpenPlanet Installer page [here](https://openplanet.dev/plugin/puzzleupdater).

Extra Info:
- Players will not be able to play passworded maps.
- You have to play maps by opening them in the editor. The script takes care of the rest.
- Do not save the map while playing it. Doing so will break both the map and script.
- The objectives menu in the editor includes some experimental features. Mess with them at your own risk.
- While it's very easy to cheat in this mode via openplanet. Doing so only cheats you out of the experience.
- Your Personal Best replays are stored at **Documents\Trackmania2020\Replays\PuzzleRecords**  
The mode uses them as backups for you PB times so do not remove or edit them.

ToDo:
- Solution Copy/Paste Feature. (Text to clipboard)
- Support for more Stock Blocks.
- Puzzle Play Sidebar for extra QOL options to not clutter main gameplay bar.
And to make room for StockBlock page scrolling.
